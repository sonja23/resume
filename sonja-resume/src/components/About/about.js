                        My name is Sonja Malmstr√∂m and I am located in Helsinki Finland.<br />
                        <br />
                        In 2017 I made one of my best decisions ever and changed my career path from Hospitality Management to Information Technology.<br />
                        <br />
                        I graduated as a Bachelor of Engineering in Information technology in 2020.<br />
                        <br />
                        I love problem solving and learning new technologies and coding languages.<br />
                        <br />
                        When I'm not coding, I'm usually knitting, going to the gym or cooking
